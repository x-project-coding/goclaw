# Deployment Guide

## Overview

Production target uses a hybrid deployment:

- GoClaw gateway runs as a bare-metal `systemd` service.
- PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector runs in Docker.
- Nginx reverse proxies public HTTP/HTTPS traffic to GoClaw on localhost.
- Codex CLI is installed on the host for future agent-controlled CLI work.

Current VPS shape:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | Private deployment value |
| SSH | Private deployment value |
| Domain | Private deployment value |
| Gateway listen | `127.0.0.1:18790` |
| Public proxy | Nginx on `80/443` |
| Postgres | Docker container `goclaw-postgres` |
| Postgres bind | `127.0.0.1:5432` |

Keep concrete hostnames, IPs, SSH users, SSH ports, and credentials in private operator notes or environment variables outside this public repository.

For command examples below:

```bash
export GOCLAW_HOST=<server-ip-or-hostname>
export GOCLAW_SSH_USER=<ssh-user>
export GOCLAW_SSH_PORT=<ssh-port>
export GOCLAW_DOMAIN=<public-domain>
```

## Server Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/opt/goclaw/releases/<release>` | Immutable GoClaw release directory |
| `/opt/goclaw/current` | Symlink to active release |
| `/opt/goclaw/shared/docker-compose.postgres.yml` | Postgres compose file |
| `/opt/goclaw/shared/postgres.env` | Postgres env file |
| `/opt/goclaw/backups/` | Uploaded DB backup files |
| `/etc/goclaw/config.json` | Gateway config |
| `/etc/goclaw/goclaw.env` | Gateway env and secrets |
| `/etc/goclaw/r2-backup.env` | R2 backup env and secrets |
| `/var/lib/goclaw/data` | GoClaw persistent data |
| `/var/lib/goclaw/workspace` | Agent workspace |
| `/var/lib/goclaw/postgres` | Postgres Docker data |
| `/usr/local/bin/goclaw-deploy` | Release switch, upgrade, health-check, rollback |
| `/usr/local/bin/goclaw-issue-ssl` | Certbot wrapper for the deployment domain |
| `/usr/local/bin/goclaw-backup-r2` | Postgres dump, R2 upload, retention cleanup |

Secrets are stored only in server env files. Do not copy tokens or database passwords into repo docs.

## Runtime Services

Check status:

```bash
ssh -p "$GOCLAW_SSH_PORT" "$GOCLAW_SSH_USER@$GOCLAW_HOST"
systemctl status goclaw --no-pager
systemctl status nginx --no-pager
systemctl status goclaw-backup-r2.timer --no-pager
docker ps --filter name=goclaw-postgres
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18790/health
```

Expected health:

```json
{"status":"ok","protocol":3}
```

## Initial Deployment Record

Completed on 2026-05-17:

- Installed Docker, Docker Compose v2, Nginx, Certbot, Node.js 22, Codex CLI.
- Added the operator workstation SSH public key to the deployment user.
- Installed Codex CLI. User still needs to run `codex --login` interactively.
- Restored the latest private PostgreSQL backup into Docker Postgres.
- Upgraded restored schema from `57` to `65`.
- Started the initial GoClaw release by `systemd`.
- Added automated database backup to a private Cloudflare R2 bucket.
- Verified local and Nginx health endpoints.

Current verification snapshot:

```text
goclaw_active=active
nginx_active=active
health_local={"status":"ok","protocol":3}
health_nginx={"status":"ok","protocol":3}
docker=goclaw-postgres pgvector/pgvector:pg18 healthy
schema=65
codex=codex-cli 0.130.0
```

## DNS And SSL

Cloudflare DNS record:

| Type | Name | Value | Proxy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `A` | Deployment subdomain | Deployment host IP | Proxied |

SSL was issued with Certbot for the deployment domain on 2026-05-17 and Certbot installed automatic renewal.

Verify HTTPS:

```bash
ssh -p "$GOCLAW_SSH_PORT" "$GOCLAW_SSH_USER@$GOCLAW_HOST"
curl -fsS "https://$GOCLAW_DOMAIN/health"
```

Re-issue manually if needed:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/goclaw-issue-ssl
```

## Deploy A New Release

Build locally with embedded web UI:

```bash
cd ui/web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
cd ../..
rm -rf internal/webui/dist
mkdir -p internal/webui/dist
cp -r ui/web/dist/* internal/webui/dist/
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 \
  go build -tags embedui \
  -ldflags="-s -w -X github.com/nextlevelbuilder/goclaw/cmd.Version=<version>" \
  -o dist/goclaw-linux-amd64 .
```

Upload:

```bash
release=<version-or-date>
ssh -p "$GOCLAW_SSH_PORT" "$GOCLAW_SSH_USER@$GOCLAW_HOST" "mkdir -p /opt/goclaw/releases/$release/migrations"
scp -P "$GOCLAW_SSH_PORT" dist/goclaw-linux-amd64 "$GOCLAW_SSH_USER@$GOCLAW_HOST:/opt/goclaw/releases/$release/goclaw"
scp -P "$GOCLAW_SSH_PORT" migrations/* "$GOCLAW_SSH_USER@$GOCLAW_HOST:/opt/goclaw/releases/$release/migrations/"
ssh -p "$GOCLAW_SSH_PORT" "$GOCLAW_SSH_USER@$GOCLAW_HOST" "chmod +x /opt/goclaw/releases/$release/goclaw && sudo /usr/local/bin/goclaw-deploy /opt/goclaw/releases/$release"
```

`goclaw-deploy` does:

1. Validate binary and migrations.
2. Switch `/opt/goclaw/current`.
3. Run `goclaw upgrade`.
4. Restart `goclaw`.
5. Poll `/health`.
6. Roll back symlink and restart if health fails.

## Backup And Restore

Automated backups:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Timer | `goclaw-backup-r2.timer` |
| Schedule | Every 6 hours: `00:00`, `06:00`, `12:00`, `18:00` server time |
| Source | Docker Postgres container `goclaw-postgres` |
| Format | PostgreSQL custom dump, `pg_dump -Fc` |
| Local directory | `/opt/goclaw/backups/` |
| R2 bucket | Private deployment value |
| R2 prefix | Private deployment value |
| Retention | Keep latest 20 backups locally and in R2 |

Check timer and latest logs:

```bash
systemctl list-timers goclaw-backup-r2.timer --no-pager
journalctl -u goclaw-backup-r2.service -n 80 --no-pager
```

Run a manual backup:

```bash
sudo systemctl start goclaw-backup-r2.service
```

Create a database dump on server:

```bash
ts=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
docker exec goclaw-postgres pg_dump -U goclaw -Fc -d goclaw > /opt/goclaw/backups/goclaw-$ts.dump
```

Restore a dump:

```bash
systemctl stop goclaw
docker exec -i goclaw-postgres pg_restore -U goclaw -d goclaw --clean --if-exists --no-owner < /opt/goclaw/backups/<file>.dump
sudo /usr/local/bin/goclaw-deploy /opt/goclaw/current
```

## Operational Notes

- Gateway runs as Linux user `goclaw`.
- Host-control exceptions are deployment-specific and must be documented privately, not in this public runbook.
- Workspace restriction settings are deployment-specific and must be reviewed before enabling agent-controlled host operations.
- Postgres is bound only to localhost.
- UFW allows the private SSH port, `80/tcp`, and `443/tcp`.
- Reboot is recommended later because the VPS reports a pending kernel upgrade.

## Troubleshooting

Logs:

```bash
journalctl -u goclaw -n 200 --no-pager
docker logs goclaw-postgres --tail 100
tail -n 100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

Restart:

```bash
systemctl restart goclaw
docker compose --env-file /opt/goclaw/shared/postgres.env -f /opt/goclaw/shared/docker-compose.postgres.yml restart postgres
systemctl reload nginx
```

Unresolved questions: none.
