# 21 - Agent Evolution & Skill Management

Three subsystems enable agents to evolve their behavior and capture reusable workflows over time. All restricted to **predefined agents** only.

| Subsystem | Purpose | Mechanism | Config Key |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Self-Evolution | Agent refines its own tone/voice | write_file → SOUL.md | `self_evolve` |
| Skill Learning | Agent learns to create skills from experience | System prompt guidance + nudges + consent | `skill_evolve` |
| Skill Management | Create, patch, delete, grant skills | `skill_manage` tool + HTTP/WS API | (always available when skill_evolve=true) |

## 1. Self-Evolution (SOUL.md)

### 1.1 What It Does

Predefined agents can refine their communication style by updating their own `SOUL.md` file through conversation. No dedicated tool needed — the agent uses the standard `write_file` tool. Context file interceptor ensures only SOUL.md is writable; IDENTITY.md and AGENTS.md remain locked.

### 1.2 Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Location |
|-----|------|---------|----------|
| `self_evolve` | boolean | `false` | `agents.other_config` JSONB |

- **Predefined agents only.** Open agents ignore this setting.
- **UI:** General tab → Self-Evolution toggle (shown only for predefined agents).

### 1.3 System Prompt Guidance

Injected by `buildSelfEvolveSection()` when `self_evolve=true` AND `agent_type=predefined` AND not in bootstrap mode.

```
## Self-Evolution

You have self-evolution enabled. You may update your SOUL.md file to
refine your communication style over time.

What you CAN evolve in SOUL.md:
- Tone, voice, and manner of speaking
- Response style and formatting preferences
- Vocabulary and phrasing patterns
- Interaction patterns based on user feedback

What you MUST NOT change:
- Your name, identity, or contact information
- Your core purpose or role
- Any content in IDENTITY.md or AGENTS.md (these remain locked)

Make changes incrementally. Only update SOUL.md when you notice clear
patterns in user feedback or interaction style preferences.
```

**Token cost:** ~95 tokens per request.

### 1.4 Security

| Layer | Enforcement |
|-------|-------------|
| System prompt | CAN/MUST NOT guidance limits scope |
| Context file interceptor | Validates only SOUL.md is writable |
| File locking | IDENTITY.md, AGENTS.md always read-only |

---

## 2. Skill Learning Loop (skill_evolve)

### 2.1 What It Does

Encourages agents to capture reusable workflows as skills after complex tasks. Three touch points in the agent loop:

1. **System prompt guidance** — SHOULD/SHOULD NOT criteria for skill creation
2. **Budget nudges** — ephemeral reminders at 70% and 90% of iteration budget
3. **Postscript suggestion** — appended to final response, requires user consent

No skill is created without explicit user approval ("save as skill" or "skip").

### 2.2 Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `skill_evolve` | boolean | `false` | Enable skill learning loop |
| `skill_nudge_interval` | integer | `15` | Minimum tool calls before postscript fires |

Both stored in `agents.other_config` JSONB. Parsed by `ParseSkillEvolve()` and `ParseSkillNudgeInterval()` in `agent_store.go`.

**Predefined agents only.** Enforced at the resolver level: `SkillEvolve` is set to `true` only when `AgentType == "predefined"` and the `skill_evolve` config flag is enabled. Open agents always get `skillEvolve=false` regardless of DB setting.

**UI:** Config tab → Skill Learning section (toggle + interval input).

    style O fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2
```

### 2.4 System Prompt Guidance

Injected by `buildSkillsSection()` when `HasSkillManage=true` (requires both `skill_evolve=true` AND `skill_manage` tool registered).

```
### Skill Creation (recommended after complex tasks)

After completing a complex task (5+ tool calls), consider:
"Would this process be useful again in the future?"

SHOULD create skill when:
- Process is repeatable with different inputs
- Multiple steps that are easy to forget
- Domain-specific workflow others could benefit from

SHOULD NOT create skill when:
- One-time task specific to this user/context
- Debugging or troubleshooting (too context-dependent)
- Simple tasks (< 5 tool calls)
- User explicitly said "skip" or declined

Creating: skill_manage(action="create", content="---\nname: ...\n...", files={"references/guide.md":"..."})
Improving: skill_manage(action="patch", slug="...", find="...", replace="...", files={"references/guide.md":"..."})
Removing: skill_manage(action="delete", slug="...")

Constraints:
- You can only manage skills you created (not system or other users' skills)
- Use files for small text companion files. Use publish_skill or ZIP upload for full directories and binary assets.
- Quality over quantity — one excellent skill beats five mediocre ones
- Ask user before creating if unsure
```

If no skills are inlined and no `skill_search` is available, a parent `## Skills` header is added automatically.

**Token cost:** ~135 tokens per request.

### 2.5 Budget Nudges

Ephemeral user messages injected mid-loop. Not persisted to session history. Sent at most once per run each.

**70% iteration budget:**
```
[System] You are at 70% of your iteration budget. Consider whether any
patterns from this session would make a good skill.
```

**90% iteration budget:**
```
[System] You are at 90% of your iteration budget. If this session involved
reusable patterns, consider saving them as a skill before completing.
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Message role | `user` (consistent with bootstrap nudge pattern) |
| Prefix | `[System]` (consistent with existing system nudges) |
| Ephemeral | Yes — in-memory only, not persisted to session |
| i18n | `i18n.T(locale, MsgSkillNudge70Pct)` / `MsgSkillNudge90Pct` |
| Token cost | ~31 / ~48 tokens each |

### 2.6 Postscript Suggestion

Appended to the agent's final response when conditions are met. User sees it inline and can explicitly consent.

**Conditions:** `skill_evolve=true` AND `skill_nudge_interval > 0` AND `totalToolCalls >= skill_nudge_interval` AND response not empty AND not silent AND not already sent this run.

**Text (English):**
```
---
_This task involved several steps. Want me to save the process as a
reusable skill? Reply "save as skill" or "skip"._
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Once per run | Yes — `skillPostscriptSent` flag |
| i18n | `i18n.T(locale, MsgSkillNudgePostscript)` |
| Token cost | ~35 tokens (persisted in session) |

### 2.7 Tool Gating

When `skill_evolve=false`, `skill_manage` is completely hidden from the LLM:

1. **API params**: filtered from `toolDefs` before sending to provider
2. **System prompt tooling**: filtered from `toolNames` used in prompt construction

The tool remains in the shared registry (admin can see it) but the agent has zero awareness of it.

---

## 3. Skill Management

### 3.1 Overview

Two paths for creating skills programmatically:

| Path | Interface | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `skill_manage` | Content string plus optional text companion files | Agent creates during conversation (learning loop) |
| `publish_skill` | Directory path | Agent creates via filesystem (see [doc 16](./16-skill-publishing.md)) |

Admin management via HTTP API + WebSocket RPC. Grants system controls per-agent and per-user access.

### 3.2 skill_manage Tool

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `action` | string | yes | `create`, `patch`, or `delete` |
| `slug` | string | patch/delete | Unique skill identifier (auto-derived from name on create) |
| `content` | string | create | Full SKILL.md including YAML frontmatter |
| `find` | string | patch | Exact text to find in current SKILL.md |
| `replace` | string | patch | Replacement text |
| `files` | object | no | Optional text companion files keyed by relative path, e.g. `references/guide.md` |
| `visibility` | string | patch | Optional metadata-only visibility change when no content/files change |

**Operations flow:**

### 3.3 publish_skill Tool

Directory-based alternative. See [16 - Skill Publishing System](./16-skill-publishing.md) for full details.

| Dimension | `skill_manage` | `publish_skill` |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Input | SKILL.md content plus optional files map | Directory path |
| Files | SKILL.md plus direct text companion files; patch copies existing companions forward | Entire directory (scripts, assets, etc.) |
| Dependency scan | Yes (warn only) | Yes (warn only) |
| Auto-grant | Yes | Yes |
| Skill creation guidance | Yes (skill_evolve prompt) | No (uses skill-creator core skill) |
| Gated by | `skill_evolve` config | Always available (builtin tool toggle) |

### 3.4 HTTP API

All endpoints require authentication (`authMiddleware`). Mutation endpoints require ownership or admin role.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/skills` | List all skills (admin) |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/{id}` | Get skill details |
| `PUT` | `/v1/skills/{id}` | Update metadata (owner/admin) |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/skills/{id}` | Delete/archive skill (owner/admin) |

| `POST` | `/v1/skills/install-deps` | Install all missing deps |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/runtimes` | Check python3/node availability |

### 3.5 Skill Self-Evolution

Skill self-evolution tracks how each existing skill performs over time. It is
separate from agent-level `skill_evolve`, which teaches agents when to create or
patch reusable skills.

**Runtime recording**

- `use_skill` tool calls record tenant-scoped usage with status `succeeded` or
  `failed`, duration, session key, run/trace ID, agent ID, and user scope.
- Slash-command activation records a `started` event when `/<slug>` or
  `/use <skill>` resolves to a skill.
- Usage writes are internal only. v1 intentionally has no public
  `POST /v1/skills/{id}/usage` endpoint, so clients cannot forge success rates.

**Persistent tables**

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `skill_evolution_settings` | Per-tenant, per-skill enabled flag and mode |
| `skill_usage_metrics` | Runtime usage events and status counts |
| `skill_improvement_suggestions` | Skill-scoped suggestions with evidence and draft patches |
| `skill_versions` | Immutable applied-version records linked to changed files and suggestions |

**HTTP and CLI controls**

- HTTP: `GET/PATCH /v1/skills/{id}/evolution`,
  `GET /v1/skills/{id}/metrics`,
  `GET /v1/skills/{id}/activity`, and suggestion approve/reject/apply endpoints.
- CLI: `goclaw skills evolve`, `goclaw skills metrics`,
  `goclaw skills suggestions`, and `goclaw skills activity`.
- Web UI: Skill detail has an `evolution` tab for settings, metrics,
  suggestions, and admin-visible activity.

**Guardrails**

- Default mode is `suggest_only`; no automatic patching happens in v1.
- Applying a suggestion to a custom skill copies the current skill directory to
  the next version, validates the target path, runs the SKILL.md guard scanner
  when needed, updates the active skill, records `skill_versions`, and writes an
  activity log entry.
- System/bundled skill mutation is refused by the apply path.
- Viewer surfaces are sanitized. Failure evidence, draft patches, actor IDs,
  and activity details require admin visibility.

**Relationship to self-improving skills**

This v1 is the control-plane foundation for self-improving skills: runtime usage
events, evidence-backed suggestions, reference-file patches, version records,
and approval/audit surfaces. It does not yet run a consolidation extractor that
turns repeated corrections into learning notes or auto-applies user-scoped
reference overlays. That higher-level learning loop belongs above this
foundation and must keep scope separation, private-content filtering, evidence
thresholds, and owner/admin approval policies explicit.

### 3.6 WebSocket RPC

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `skills.list` | List skills with enabled/status/deps |
| `skills.get` | Get skill content by name |
| `skills.update` | Update metadata (ownership-protected) |

### 3.7 Grants & Visibility

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    [*] --> private : Skill created
    private --> internal : GrantToAgent / GrantToUser
    internal --> private : Last grant revoked
    internal --> public : Admin promotes

    state private {
        [*] : Owner only
    }
    state internal {
        [*] : Granted agents/users
    }
    state public {
        [*] : All agents
    }
```

**Access resolution** (`ListAccessible` query):

| Visibility | Who can access |
|------------|---------------|
| `public` | All agents |
| `internal` | Agents/users with explicit grants |
| `private` | Owner only |
| `is_system=true` | All agents (always) |

Grant/revoke operations require **ownership or admin role**.

    style L4 fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#ad1457
```

### 4.1 Content Guard (`guard.go`)

Line-by-line regex scan of SKILL.md content **before** any disk write. Hard-reject on ANY violation. 25 rules in 6 categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Destructive shell | `rm -rf /`, fork bomb, `dd of=/dev/`, `mkfs`, `shred` |
| Code injection | `base64 -d \| sh`, `eval $(...)`, `curl \| bash`, `python -c exec()` |
| Credential exfil | `/etc/passwd`, `.ssh/id_rsa`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GOCLAW_DB_URL` |
| Path traversal | `../../../` deep traversal |
| SQL injection | `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE` |
| Privilege escalation | `sudo`, world-writable `chmod`, `chown root` |

Not exhaustive — defense-in-depth layer. GoClaw's `exec` tool has its own runtime deny-list for shell commands.

### 4.2 Ownership Enforcement

Three-layer ownership check across all mutation paths:

| Layer | File | Check |
|-------|------|-------|
| Tool | `skill_manage.go` | `GetSkillOwnerIDBySlug(slug)` before patch/delete |
| HTTP | `skills.go`, `skills_grants.go` | `GetSkillOwnerID(uuid)` + `permissions.HasMinRole` admin bypass |
| WS Gateway | `gateway/methods/skills.go` | `skillOwnerGetter` interface + `client.Role()` admin bypass |

System skills (`is_system=true`) cannot be modified through any path.

### 4.3 Filesystem Safety

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Symlink detection | `filepath.WalkDir` + `d.Type()&os.ModeSymlink` check |
| Path traversal | Direct `skill_manage(files=...)` payload rejects absolute paths, Windows drive paths, null bytes, `..`, `SKILL.md`, dotfiles/dotdirs, and system artifacts |
| Content size limit | 100KB max for SKILL.md content |
| Companion size limit | Direct `skill_manage(files=...)` text files are capped at 2MB each. Existing companions copy forward with the 20MB total copy limit. ZIP upload remains configurable, default 20MB and clamped to 1-500MB |
| Soft-delete | Files moved to `.trash/`, never hard-deleted |

---

## 5. Versioning & Storage

Skills use immutable versioned directories. Each create or patch produces a new version:

```
skills-store/
├── my-skill/
│   ├── 1/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md
│   │   └── scripts/
│   └── 2/          ← patch creates new version
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── scripts/  (copied from v1)
├── .trash/
│   └── old-skill.1710000000   ← soft-deleted
```

**Concurrency control:** `pg_advisory_xact_lock` keyed on FNV-64a hash of slug serializes concurrent version creation for the same skill.

**Database:** `CreateSkillManaged` uses `ON CONFLICT(slug) DO UPDATE` + `RETURNING id` to handle upserts atomically. Version computed inside the transaction via `COALESCE(MAX(version), 0) + 1`.

---

## 6. Token Cost

| Component | When Active | ~Tokens | Persistent? |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Self-evolve section | `self_evolve=true` | ~95 | Every request |
| Skill creation guidance | `skill_evolve=true` | ~135 | Every request |
| `skill_manage` tool definition | `skill_evolve=true` | ~290 | Every request |
| Budget nudge 70% | iter >= 70% of max | ~31 | No (ephemeral) |
| Budget nudge 90% | iter >= 90% of max | ~48 | No (ephemeral) |
| Postscript | toolCalls >= interval | ~35 | Yes (in session) |

**Total maximum overhead per run:** ~305 tokens for skill learning (~1.5% of 128K context).

When both features are disabled (default), zero token overhead.

## 8. Agent Evolution Metrics System (V3)

V3 introduces automated agent improvement via metrics-driven suggestions. Agents track tool usage, retrieval performance, and user feedback to generate actionable evolution recommendations.

### 8.1 Metrics Collection

Metrics are recorded during agent execution and stored per-agent in the database. Three metric types:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **tool** | Tool invocation performance | invocation_count, success_rate, failure_count, avg_duration_ms |
| **retrieval** | Knowledge retrieval quality | recall_rate, precision, relevance_score, query_count |
| **feedback** | User satisfaction signals | rating, sentiment, effectiveness_score |

**Collection points:**
- Tool execution: name, status (success/failure), duration recorded in agent loop
- Retrieval queries: recall metrics computed from vector search results
- User feedback: optional post-run feedback API or implicit signals (abort/rephrase patterns)

Metrics aggregate over 7-day rolling windows for suggestion analysis.

### 8.2 Suggestion Engine

`SuggestionEngine` analyzes aggregated metrics and generates suggestions via pluggable rules.

**Architecture:**

```
Metrics Aggregation (7-day window)
    ↓
Rule Evaluation (run daily/weekly)
    ├─ LowRetrievalUsageRule
    ├─ ToolFailureRule
    └─ RepeatedToolRule
    ↓
Suggestion Creation (pending status)
    ↓
Admin Review → Approve/Reject/Rollback
```

**Suggestion Types:**

| Type | Trigger | Recommendation | Parameters |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| `low_retrieval_usage` | Avg recall < threshold for 7 days | Lower `retrieval_threshold` parameter | `{current_threshold, proposed_threshold, confidence}` |
| `tool_failure` | Single tool failure rate > 20% | Review tool config or fallback | `{tool_name, failure_count, success_count}` |
| `repeated_tool` | Tool called 5+ consecutive times without context change | Consider extracting as skill | `{tool_name, occurrence_count, pattern_score}` |

**Duplicate Prevention:** Only one pending suggestion per type per agent. New analyses skip rules that already have pending suggestions.

### 8.3 Auto-Adapt Guardrails

Suggestions can be auto-applied with safety constraints (optional admin-enabled). Guardrails prevent runaway adaptation.

**Constraints:**

| Name | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `max_delta_per_cycle` | 0.1 | Max parameter change per apply cycle (prevents aggressive swings) |
| `min_data_points` | 100 | Minimum metrics before applying (avoid overfitting on small sample) |
| `rollback_on_drop_pct` | 20.0 | Auto-rollback if quality metric drops >20% after apply |
| `locked_params` | `[]` | Parameters that cannot be auto-changed (e.g., security settings) |

**Apply Flow:**

1. Admin approves `low_retrieval_usage` suggestion (raises `retrieval_threshold` by +0.05)
2. System checks: min_data_points met? parameter not locked? delta ≤ 0.1? → OK
3. Baseline values saved for rollback
4. Suggestion status → `applied`
5. Monitor: if recall drops >20%, auto-rollback and set status → `rolled_back`

**Baseline Storage:**

Previous parameter values stored in suggestion `parameters._baseline` for rollback:

```json
{
  "current_threshold": 0.5,
  "proposed_threshold": 0.55,
  "_baseline": {
    "retrieval_threshold": 0.5
  }
}
```

### 8.4 Cron Scheduling

Evolution analysis runs as a periodic cron job (default: daily).

**Schedule:** Configurable via `evolution_cron_schedule` in agent config. Examples: `every day at 02:00`, `every 7 days at sunday 02:00`.

**Execution:**
1. Load all agents in tenant
2. For each agent: `engine.Analyze(ctx, agentID)`
3. Create pending suggestions (if new findings detected)
4. Log results: created suggestions count, skipped rules, errors

**Cron Event:** `evolution.analysis.completed` event emitted on completion.

### 8.5 API & WebSocket

**HTTP Endpoints** (see [18 — HTTP REST API](18-http-api.md#14-evolution-metrics--suggestions)):
- `GET /v1/agents/{agentID}/evolution/metrics` — Query/aggregate metrics
- `GET /v1/agents/{agentID}/evolution/suggestions` — List suggestions
- `PATCH /v1/agents/{agentID}/evolution/suggestions/{suggestionID}` — Approve/reject/rollback

**WebSocket Methods** (see [19 — WebSocket RPC](19-websocket-rpc.md)):
- `agent.evolution.metrics` — Get metrics
- `agent.evolution.suggestions` — List suggestions
- `agent.evolution.apply` — Apply suggestion
- `agent.evolution.rollback` — Rollback applied suggestion

### 8.6 Configuration

Per-agent evolution settings stored in `agents.other_config` JSONB:

```json
{
  "evolution_enabled": true,
  "evolution_guardrails": {
    "max_delta_per_cycle": 0.1,
    "min_data_points": 100,
    "rollback_on_drop_pct": 20.0,
    "locked_params": ["security_level"]
  }
}
```

Defaults used if keys absent. Set `evolution_enabled: false` to disable metrics collection entirely.
